# Pinball Scores Project Walkthrough

## Overview
This project is a local pinball score tracking system. It consists of a static web frontend for viewing scores and a PowerShell-based admin backend for managing players and scraping data.

## Technologies Used
-   **HTML5**: Structure of the web pages.
-   **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Client-side logic for rendering data and interactivity.
-   **PowerShell**: Backend automation, data scraping, and local server.
-   **JSON**: Data storage format for player stats and machine records.

## Recommended Extensions
If using VS Code, the following extensions are recommended:
-   **PowerShell**: For running and debugging the admin scripts.
-   **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting.
-   **Live Server** (Optional): Alternative to the built-in `server.ps1` for viewing the site.

## How to Use the Admin App

1.  **Open Terminal**: Open PowerShell in your `c:\pinball_scores` directory.
2.  **Run the App**:
    ```powershell
    .\admin.ps1
    ```
3.  **Navigate the Menu**:
    -   **Manage Players**: Add/Remove players from `data/playerid.txt`.
    -   **Import Data**: Scrape `pinballleague.uk` and save to `data/temp/`.
    -   **Inspect Updates**: Review JSON files in `data/temp/`.
    -   **Publish Updates**: Move files from `data/temp/` to `data/`, making them live.

## Running the Website
To view the website locally:
```powershell
.\server.ps1
```
Then open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
